# Friendfinder
Friendfinder compatibility app - 
Created in late May of 2018 this app asks the user to input their name and a link to a photo, then takes them through a series of survey questions. The app takes the results of those survey questions and matches them to other users in the database, searching for the most compatible match. 

## Technologies used
For this I used node.js, Express, Body-Parser, and Path.
